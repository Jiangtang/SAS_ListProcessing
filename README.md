## List Creating
 
* %range:          produces a sequence like 1 2 3 or f1 f2 f3 or 1a 2a 3a
* %range\_non\_int:  increment a macro do loop by a non-integer value
* %suffix_counter: Create a list of variable names formed by adding a numeric counter suffix to a base name.

* %getVar: get all variables (N, C or all) from a dataset

* %qreadpipe: read the output of a system command
* %dir:       return a list of members of a directory
* %dirfpq:    return a list of full-path quoted of  members of a directory

## List Formating

* %changesep: change the separator for a list
* %seplist:   Emit a list of items separated by some delimiter

* %splitmac: insert split characters in a macro string

* %capmac:  capitalise the first letter of each  word in a macro string

## Quoting
 
* %qt:        add quotes to each element in a list
* %quotelst:  quote the elements of a list
 
* %upt:       remove quotes from each element of a list
* %qdequote:  remove front and end matching quotes from a macro string
* %dequote:   remove front and end matching quotes from a macro string

* %noquotes:  remove all quoted strings from a macro expression

* %quotecnt:  count quoted strings in a macro expression

* %quotescan: scan for a quoted string in a macro   expression

## List Properties

* %num_tokens: Count the number of “tokens” (variables) in a list.
* %countW:     Retrieve the number of words in a macro variable
* %words:      return the number of words in a string
* %windex:     return the word count position in a string


##List Manipulation

* %slice:  return a sub-list sliced by a index

* %zip:           zips two lists together by joining correponding elements, see, a b and c d ==> ac bd
* %parallel_join: Join two variable lists by connecting each variable in the first list to its correspondingvariable in the second list
* %add_string:    Add a text string to each variable in a list as either a prefix or suffix
* %xprod:         take cross product of two lists, see, a b and c d ==> ac ad bc bd

* %appmvar: append a string onto an existing macro variable
* %prefix:  return a list with a prefix added
* %suffix:  return a list with a suffix added

* %replace:       replace symbolic variable in block of code with each element of a list, see, a b and code = #=__#  ==> a=__a b=__b
* %rename_string: Create a list suitable for the rename statement
* %editlist:      edit a list of space delimited items

* %nodup:  drop duplicates in a space-delimited list

* %match:  return elements of a list that match those in a reference list

* %remove:  remove all occurrences of the target string(s) from another string
* %removew: remove all occurrences of the target word(s) from a source list of words.

* %reverse:  Reverse a macro variable's value (use %sysfunc(reverse) since v6.12)
